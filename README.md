   - `password`: Hashed password
   - `role`: Guest or Host

2. **Property**
   - `id`: Unique identifier
   - `title`: Property name
   - `location`: Address or city
   - `price_per_night`: Cost per night
   - `host_id`: Foreign key (User)

3. **Booking**
   - `id`: Unique identifier
   - `property_id`: Foreign key (Property)
   - `user_id`: Foreign key (User)
   - `start_date`: Check-in date
   - `end_date`: Check-out date

4. **Review**
   - `id`: Unique identifier
   - `user_id`: Foreign key (User)

## 🚀 Feature Breakdown

### 👤 User Management
Handles user registration, login, and role assignment. Users authenticate via JWT, and role-based access determines what actions they can take.

### 🏠 Property Management
Hosts can create and manage property listings, including uploading details such as title, images, location, and pricing.

### 📅 Booking System
Enables guests to view property availability, make reservations, and manage bookings. Includes date conflict checks and validation.

### 💬 Reviews and Ratings
Guests can leave feedback after completing a stay. These reviews are displayed on property pages to help future users.

### 💳 Payments Integration
Handles payment processing using a mock or real payment service. Payment status is tracked for each booking.

### 🔐 API Security
Authentication and authorization are applied to all protected routes. Input is validated, and sensitive data is encrypted to prevent attacks.

### 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline
Automates testing, building, and deployment using GitHub Actions and Docker. Ensures a stable and reproducible development workflow.

## 🔐 API Security

### Key Security Measures

- **Authentication (JWT)**: Verifies the identity of users via signed tokens, ensuring that only logged-in users can access restricted resources.
- **Authorization (RBAC)**: Limits access to actions based on user roles, preventing unauthorized operations.
- **Input Validation**: Prevents malicious inputs by sanitizing and validating data submitted to APIs.
- **Rate Limiting**: Limits the number of requests from a single IP to prevent brute-force attacks and abuse.
- **Data Encryption**: Hashes passwords and uses secure storage practices to protect sensitive data.
- **HTTPS**: Ensures encrypted communication between users and the server in production environments.

### Why Security Matters

- **Protects User Data**: Prevents unauthorized access to personal information and passwords.
- **Secures Transactions**: Ensures financial data during payment processing is safe.
- **Prevents System Abuse**: Limits potential attacks that can compromise system integrity.
- **Ensures Legal Compliance**: Aligns with data protection laws such as GDPR.

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

**Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** are modern DevOps practices that automate the process of:
- **CI**: Testing and merging code into the main branch frequently.
- **CD**: Deploying code changes automatically to production or staging environments.

### Why It's Important

- Ensures code is always in a deployable state.
- Speeds up delivery of features and bug fixes.
- Reduces human error during deployment.
- Encourages test-driven development and rapid feedback.

### Tools Used

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows like running tests and pushing Docker containers.
- **Docker**: Creates consistent environments for development, testing, and production.
- **Postman/Newman**: Automates API testing during the CI stage.
- **Nginx**: Manages routing and serves the application in a production setting.
